1/ Enter in the oposite direction of the previous day bar over the first 5 min bar.
 
2/ Size with a stop at the first 5min bars Low (so for Long position
Quantity= Risk/(High-Low) include rounding). Use a STPLMT order with a
range from the Entry Limit table.

3/ Bar must be within the Entry Limit table % Range Bar. i.e in this case
2%

4/ If the position is not filled by 10:30 cancel the order.

5/ If the first 5min bar High/Low is broken (so for Side=Long a break of
the Low) before entry, cancel the open order position.

6/ Add 1c to the entry price and round over/under whole/half numbers in
the direction of the trade, same for stop price.

E.g. If first 5min bar is H=21.50 L=21.15 Open= 21.2 Close=21.40 and the
Side is Long, then position order will be Buy STPLMT=21.51-21.55 (STPLMT
range 0.04 from EntryLimit table and as we are at 21.5 we also buy
over/under whole/half numbers), Quantity=Risk/(21.51-21.2) rounded to
+/-100 shares (see EntryLimit table).
